# ☠️ The Curse of ByteXync

> *“Some say the web itself carries whispers of an ancient treasure.  
> Others say it’s cursed code, meant to trap the greedy and the brave alike...”*

## 📖 Prologue

In the dark corners of the net, sailors speak of a repository.

Only those with the wits to bring the vessel to life shall glimpse what lies within.

> _“To seek what’s hidden, awaken what sleeps.  
> To claim what’s cursed, solve what teases.  
> The flag lies not in plain sight... but it **waits**.”_

## ☁️ Hushed Winds

For those who hear nothing, perhaps ye haven't **listened right**.  
Try again... but slower.
